methods in structure. I.e. Now functions have gone inside the Data type means 
compiler can start helping us in very interesting way. What is that?
[A] We do not have to write the pointer. Then who will write the pointer. 
Compiler will write it. That is "this" pointer.
[Q] Why compiler is doing this now? While it was not injecting this earlier.
[A] Because that time functions was not part of data type, Hence compiler 
was not in position to decide what to put inside that function. But now 
function is part of data type so now compiler knows for which data type it 
has to work so it has to have the pointer.

C was lacking this feature.
But after compilation there is no difference whether c or c++.

/*
So what is happening here internally [Stack.Push(&s1, 100)] we are calling push then passing
address of s1 that means we are giving more importance to push rather than s1. But it feels
that s1 is more important [s1.Push(100)] than push coz whatever we use 1st has more importance.
Because this is more real world. Why ?
[A]: S1 is of type stack [Assume an s/w developer] and S2 is of type stack [Assume another s/w developer]
so we ask S1 to develop [function name=> develop] calendar [passed data=>calendar]...
App and S2 to develop calculator App.

So

S1.Develop (calendar)
S2.Develop (calculator)

Development happening. After 1 week S1 Test it. S2 Test it.

S1.Testit()
S2.Testit()

Notice here we have called 2 more methods. Now which app S1 will test? And which app S2 will test?
We did not tell S1 and S2 which app they need to test. They remembered it.

So here S1 and S2 remembering data.

We say S1 push then S2 push. Then we say S1 pop data and it pops the correct data which S1 has pushed.
We don’t have to mention which data. It remembers which data it needs to pop. Same for S2.

What is not important here is what operation we do. The more important thing is Which OBJECT does Which OPERATION.

So here we introduced concept of Object.

What is Object?
[A]: Object is an entity "performs the work" and object "remember the data".

/*
Whenever we call function like above 1 thing compiler does for us. Compiler [Actually Linker in true sense]
injects Jump instruction with the address of function for each and every function even for printf it happens
i.e. ultimately all the function call names are removed and replaces with jump statement.

What is 800 and 900 in jump instruction?
[A]: That is the address of Push and Pop.
Who it does?
[A]: Compiler does it. Compiler assign the address to function and make sure those address are done with jump instruction.

The exe which gets created has all these. Not the function name. It has these address and jump instruction.
All calls in Line 1 to 6 will go to address 800. Line 7 and 9 will go to address 900 and so on.

Hence this is called Early Binding.

What is binding? => Putting jump instruction at the place of function call and with an address of function
definition is called the binding.

If binding is done before execution that is called early binding.
Late binding => Happens during execution.

**********COM DOES NOT USE EARLY BINDING**********

In COM we never call this way. Without COM we may call this way but NOT IN COM

**********COM FOLLOW LATE BINDING**********

In Design 4 we will see Late binding
