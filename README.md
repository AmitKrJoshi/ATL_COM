COM - ATL

My Learning and in depth notes on COM and ATL
 
This repository comtains in depth notes in COM and ATL. I'll start with basics then modify the code to see how COM makes it beautiful. Then we'll see how ATL library makes it easy

In starting little C will be mixed with C++.

We'll try to implement some code and we'll see what the problems in that code are and based on the problems we'll fix that code. We'll make it better code and we'll keep making it better and better. Slowly we'll see that we'll REACH COM. Naturally we'll be taken to the COM. No extra efforts and suddenly we'll understand what COM is. NO extra efforts provided we go in proper way.

Let’s first create a requirement- 
Implement Stack Data structure in such a way that some other code can use it.
Some other person can use it. That means we are not supposed to write main. Our code should be usable by that person’s code. We’ll will write the code so that other main can use it.

Approach-> Stack performs Push and Pop. In c operation are written as function. Stacks works in LIFO. Push will accept the value. Pop will return.
